Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

- Both group members have downloaded LUA and LOVE
- Both group members have followed the Pong CS50 Track in its entirety
- Collaborated together to finish the AI component of the game 

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

We have not installed the power-ups yet 

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

The AI that we have implemented always wins, we want to make it more fair for the player where the computer's paddle doesn't always make contact with the ball, but the AI makes an effort to hit it.
